# Markdown to HTML Renderer This is a simple, single-file web application that converts a Markdown file (`input.md`) into HTML and renders it directly in your browser. It uses **Marked.js** for Markdown parsing and **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling. ## Features - Renders `input.md` into clean, readable HTML. - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS. - Pure client-side rendering; no server required. ## How to Use 1. **Place `input.md`:** Ensure your Markdown content file is named `input.md` and placed in the same directory as `index.html`. 2. **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. The page will automatically fetch `input.md`, convert its content, and display it as HTML. ## Technologies Used - [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) - A markdown parser and compiler written in JavaScript. Built for speed. - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. ## File Structure ``` . ├── index.html ├── input.md └── README.md └── LICENSE ``` ## License This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
